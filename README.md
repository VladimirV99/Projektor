## Services

### Identity

Identity server handles user and role managment. Authentication is done using JWT and refresh tokens, while authorization is done using roles. Supported roles are `Administrator` and `Customer`.

When the service starts, an administrator account is created using the credentials specified in "Admin" section of the configuration file. For the development environment the default credentials are `admin@admin.com`/`Admin_123`. This account cannot be deleted as it will be recreated when the service restarts, so for better security the password should be changed on first login.

### Movies.API
