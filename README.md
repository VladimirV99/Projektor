## Services

### Identity

Identity server handles user and role management. Authentication is done using JWT and refresh tokens, while authorization is done using roles. Supported roles are `Administrator` and `Customer`.

When the service starts, an administrator account is created using the credentials specified in "Admin" section of the configuration file.
For the development environment the default credentials are `admin@admin.com`/`Admin_123`.
This account cannot be deleted as it will be recreated when the service restarts, so for better security the password should be changed on first login.

### Movies

#### Seeding the database:
1. Start the database container from the project root:
   ```
   docker-compose up --build -d projektor_mssql
   ```
2. Execute the seed sql script:
   ```
   docker exec -it projektor_mssql opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd -S localhost -U sa -P MatfRs2_MSSQL -d MoviesDB -e -i /var/seed/seed_script.sql 
   ```

### Review

![Review Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/VladimirV99/Projektor/Review/main?style=for-the-badge)

Review service manages movie reviews that can be created by users after watching a movie.
A review consists of a short summary, a body and a numeric score (0-10).
Users can add a review only after the screening for which they purchased a ticket ends.

This service is asynchronously notified by the reservation service when a user purchases or cancels a ticket.
User information is received from the identity service using gRPC if a local copy doesn't exist.

### Mailer

![Mailer Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/VladimirV99/Projektor/Mailer/main?style=for-the-badge)

Mailer is used by other services to send notification emails. It receives requests from the event bus on the `mail-queue` channel. The account from which the email is sent should be set in the "Email" section of the configuration file.
